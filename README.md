A project implementing various chess engines in an attempt to get familiar with machine learning

Missing: Draw by repetition, Underpromotion, draw by insufficient material

Further to do:  Rename new_pieces_possible_moves, 
                delete square_empty_or... and replace use with not square_containing_own_piece,
                polish readability of applymove,
                add function -> bool insufficient_material
